# Pokemon
pokemon in java

this project is not affiliated with nintendo 

a small remake of the classic game in a common programming language
currently requires the slick2d and lwjgl libraries to run.

unfinished.

apologies in advance for the sloppy src file, first time game maker 
attempting to learn organization skills.

To run: Make sure all files in the repository are on disk, including files located in the slick folder. Add all files in the /slick/lib folder as libraries in the project. Add -Djava.library.path="path to dll files" in the VM options of the project

Then run the file Play.java

Player can move and go into buildings and stuff. Can talk to the old man next to the PokeMart to increase exp of your main Pokemon. All movelearning is still on the command prompt at this point in time (to meet a deadline)
